# Token_contract
A simple token system where tokens can be minted and burned

This Solidity contract, titled "MyToken," creates a basic token system. It stores details like the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply. Users can mint new tokens, increasing the total supply and their balance. They can also burn tokens, ensuring sufficient balance before reducing both the total supply and their own balance. However, it lacks functionalities like transfer between addresses and advanced access control, making it suitable for educational purposes but not a fully fledged real world token.
